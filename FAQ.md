### What are usergroups and their privileges?


### How to get promoted?


### How to get yourself banned?
This will only happen if you break any of the [forum rules](https://blackpearl.biz/rules/).

### Alright, so you just joined Blackpearl! What to do now?
First of all, read the [RULES](https://blackpearl.biz/rules/) and FAQ.
Then introduce yourself [over here](https://blackpearl.biz/intro/).

### What to write for your introduction?
Don't give away personal info and write about your interests, it isn't required to be related to piracy. For example, if you're interested in philosophy, mention that and people with knowledge about it will react to your post.
You should mention where you belong to(not asking for address, only country/state/city), how you came to know about the forum, then what type content you are looking for, and if in case you have done something recognisable, or have been in some other reputed forums you can mention all that.
This was supposed to filter out the trolls, but, honestly if you write something good people would be happy and friendly with you!

### What to post in the 'Pearls-Only' section?
You can post only original upload/rare stuff. 
You can hide the content with this tag `[pearl=0]your content[/pearl]`.

### You just made a post but it's not showing up anymore, what's happening?
It's most probably in the Approval Queue or already deleted due to breaking rules or improper format/missing stuff.
The current system does not inform the poster about their post getting rejected. If you post something worthless we won't even inform you in PM.

### Why is the like button not visible to me?
If you are a new user you need to post an introduction to be able to get access to rest ofthe forum, you can view posts but cannot react to them unless you post your intro.

### What is the meaning of "YOU HAVE INSUFFICIENT PRIVILEGES TO REPLY HERE."?

If you would like to access these sections you have contribute on forum to get Pirate Tag, Pirate group can be purchased from [shop](https://blackpearl.biz/shop/) with 75 pearls.

### How to check how many pearls I have? Who is the richest user?
[Clicking here](https://blackpearl.biz/pearls/) you can check how many pearls do you have, who the richest user is, and all the pearls you won/spent.

### I just created a thread/post but can't see it posted.
If you are a Registered user or lower anything you post will be awaiting for approval from a Moderator. Once approved the post will become available on the forum.

### How long does it take to have a post approved on the forum?
There isn't a specific time range for a post to be approved. Posts will be approved once a Moderator is available and goes through the posts needing approval. Usually posts don't take more than 24 hours to be approved.


### How does one add a picture to a post? And what imagehosters I can use?
You can do this by clicking on the [little image icon](https://uploaddeimagens.com.br/images/002/359/857/original/2019-09-19_181337.png?1568927759) at the post tollbar or using the hotkey `Ctrl+P`. If you are using [bbcode](https://www.phpbb.com/) you have to use `[IMG]` tag. Example: `[IMG]https://hoster.com/image.png[/IMG]`.

For that you need to use imagehoster for that we recommend [ImgBB](https://imgbb.com/), [imgur](https://imgur.com) or [PostImages](https://postimages.org/) but you can use any other, since it allows you to reach the orginal image link. Example: `https://hoster.com/image.png`.

In case you prefer to use Imgur, then instead of copying the default link that they provide, go over the image and press the three dot button, from there select `Get Share Links` and copy the link that says `BBCode(Forums)`. After that paste the link to your post, it won't show image in edit mode, if you want to resize then just press the preview button, the image will be loaded in both preview and edit mode.
